          Hello guys, I am Shakya Bera. My code name is Antimony. I have kept it
          so, because my initials are Sb and on the periodic table, Sb is the
          symbol for Antimony. This is my second website and is also a quite
          successful one. You can see my previous website on my Github page. I I
          can't tell you about my class, because it is a variable which is
          incremented by one in interval of every 365.25 days. So, I can only
          tell that, I made the website when i was in class 7. Obviously, I like
          coding. Coding, Drawing, Reading books, etc. are my hobbies. I live in
          Kotalghata, Uluberia, Howrah. But again, this is also one variable
          which can change according to the end-user (me). :) And yeah, that's
          me in the picture.
