          On day one, we woke up at 4:00 am in the morning, because we had our
          flight at 9:05 am. We got ready boarded our cab and reached the
          airport. There we performed all the check in processes. After that, we
          had an hour to wait and nothing to do. So I started window shopping.
          Like this, I wasted a good amount of time and got ready for boarding
          our plane. Sadly I wasn't able to take pictures of the plane, or
          pictures inside the plane. Then we landed on Bagdogra, our driver was
          waiting for us. We were quite lucky and got a Tata Sumo GOLD (it is
          -24 Karat gold). Now see the video for the experiencing my journey to
          Lamahatta.

          On the way we halted at Teesta Triveni. It is the meeting point of
          Rangeet and Teesta River. It is a beach type place, which is covered
          with rocks. The place is amazing. Try to absorb the beauty of the
          place with the help of the video.

          Next we went to the Lovers Meet View Point. This is just 4 kms above
          the Teesta Triveni. It is a top down view of the meeting point. And
          this is the place where we ate momos, to our hearts content. They were
          really cheap and tasty also. The view point was very nice and from
          top, the distinct colors of the two rivers were clearly visible. See
          the video, go on.

          Then we headed for the abode of orange orchards and pine gardens,
          Lamhatta, i.e the 9th Mile. After reaching the place, a we arrived at
          a state of perfect happiness. The view was literally awesome. Just see
          the video... ( Am I not able to write or the place is to beautiful to
          be described, Haha :) )

          We started the day with a walk to the Lamhatta Ecotourism park. On the
          ticket counter we saw a stone incription. Salute to the Martyrs !

          After getting the tickets we headed for the sacred lake, which was
          uphill, and we had to wake for about 40 minutes. It was quiet
          tiresome. Here I am giving some pictures of park and lake. The lake
          was amazing. The look you get after a lengthy walk is awesome.
